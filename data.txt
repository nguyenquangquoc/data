"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\nBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don\'t tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more\nto do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my \'faithful\nslave,\' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news."\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer."\n\n"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\'s mind\nat rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?"\n\n"And the fete at the English ambassador\'s? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there."\n\n"I thought today\'s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."\n\n"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n"Don\'t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev\'s\ndispatch? You know everything."\n\n"What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. "What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours."\n\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\npart. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\nbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel\nlike it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\nexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\ndid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\nas in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\nwhich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\ncorrect.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst\nout:\n\n"Oh, don\'t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\'t understand things,\nbut Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is\nbetraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\nrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\nthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\nnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\nrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\nthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\none.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\nspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander\'s loftiness\nof soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and\nstill seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did\nNovosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\nunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\nhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\nthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don\'t believe a word\nthat Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\nneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\ndestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!"\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been sent\ninstead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of\nPrussia\'s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a\ncup of tea?"\n\n"In a moment. A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am expecting\ntwo very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is\nconnected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And\nalso the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\nreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?"\n\n"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me," he\nadded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,\nthough the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his\nvisit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be\nappointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor\ncreature."\n\nPrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\ntrying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the\nbaron.\n\nAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\npleased with.\n\n"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,"\nwas all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna\'s face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\nbeaucoup d\'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pavlovna wished\nboth to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\nrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\nsaid:\n\n"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out\neveryone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\nbeautiful."\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n"I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to\nthe prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and\nsocial topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\nconversation--"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are\ndistributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don\'t\nspeak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\'t like him," she added in a tone\nadmitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. "Two such charming\nchildren. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you\ndon\'t deserve to have them."\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n"I can\'t help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I lack the\nbump of paternity."\n\n"Don\'t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am\ndissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her face\nassumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her Majesty\'s\nand you were pitied...."\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n"What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all a\nfather could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\nis the only difference between them." He said this smiling in a way more\nnatural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth\nvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.\n\n"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father\nthere would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna Pavlovna,\nlooking up pensively.\n\n"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\nis how I explain it to myself. It can\'t be helped!"\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\ngesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\n\n"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she\nasked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\ndon\'t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is\nvery unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary\nBolkonskaya."\n\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of\nthe head that he was considering this information.\n\n"Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\ncurrent of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\nrubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in five\nyears, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That\'s what we\nfathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?"\n\n"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the\nwell-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the\nlate Emperor, and was nicknamed \'the King of Prussia.\' He is very clever\nbut eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a\nbrother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an\naide-de-camp of Kutuzov\'s and will be here tonight."\n\n"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovna\'s\nhand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange that affair for\nme and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a\nvillage elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good\nfamily and that\'s all I want."\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\nmaid of honor\'s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as\nhe lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n"Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I\'ll speak to Lise, young\nBolkonski\'s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be\narranged. It shall be on your family\'s behalf that I\'ll start my\napprenticeship as old maid."\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age\nand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.\nPrince Vasili\'s daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father\nto the ambassador\'s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge\nas maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as la\nfemme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg, * was also there. She had been\nmarried during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any\nlarge gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasili\'s son,\nHippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio\nand many others had also come.\n\n\n* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\n\nTo each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, "You have not yet seen my aunt,"\nor "You do not know my aunt?" and very gravely conducted him or her to a\nlittle old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come\nsailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and\nslowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovna\nmentioned each one\'s name and then left them.\n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not\none of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them\ncared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and\nsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in\nthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her\nMajesty, "who, thank God, was better today." And each visitor, though\npoliteness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a\nsense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return\nto her the whole evening.\n\nThe young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold-\nembroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate\ndark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it\nlifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she\noccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case\nwith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness of her\nupper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special and\npeculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty\nyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and\ncarrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones\nwho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a\nlittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life\nand health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile\nand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a\nspecially amiable mood that day.\n\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying\nsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat\ndown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a\npleasure to herself and to all around her. "I have brought my work,"\nsaid she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.\n"Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me," she\nadded, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to be quite a\nsmall reception, and just see how badly I am dressed." And she spread\nout her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress,\ngirdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.\n\n"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,"\nreplied Anna Pavlovna.\n\n"You know," said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\nFrench, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me? He is going\nto get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she\nadded, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she\nturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.\n\n"What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince Vasili to\nAnna Pavlovna.\n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with\nclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable\nat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout\nyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known\ngrandee of Catherine\'s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man\nhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only\njust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his\nfirst appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she\naccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of\nthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight\nof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face\nwhen she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than\nthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the\nclever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which\ndistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.\n\n"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\ninvalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt\nas she conducted him to her.\n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as\nif in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little\nprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the\naunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty\'s health. Anna\nPavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know the Abbe\nMorio? He is a most interesting man."\n\n"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\ninteresting but hardly feasible."\n\n"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and get\naway to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a\nreverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had\nfinished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who\nwished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart,\nhe began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe\'s plan chimerical.\n\n"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.\n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she\nresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready\nto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the\nforeman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes\nround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that\ncreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the\nmachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her\ndrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a\nword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,\nproper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about\nPierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached\nthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and\nagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe.\n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovna\'s\nwas the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the\nintellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child\nin a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any\nclever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and\nrefined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting\nto hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the\nconversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity\nto express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.\n\nAnna Pavlovna\'s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed\nsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,\nbeside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face\nwas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had\nsettled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the\nabbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess\nHelene, Prince Vasili\'s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,\nvery pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third\ngroup was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.\n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished\nmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\npoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in\nwhich he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a\ntreat to her guests. As a clever maitre d\'hotel serves up as a specially\nchoice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the\nkitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to her\nguests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice\nmorsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the\nmurder of the Duc d\'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d\'Enghien had\nperished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons\nfor Buonaparte\'s hatred of him.\n
